## Installation

This project can be cloned from the repository and initiated with an npm install to download
the necessary dependencies to run the application on your local machine. The application is
also being hosted on heroku.

## Description

This application was created for two reasons. 
 1. For any person or persons who have used a
restroom at any specific location and would like to submit a review of their experience.
 2. If someone is planning to take a trip or is just out and about on the town and needs to make a stop
at a local business to use the restroom they can search the database for a specific zip code and
return all previously submitted reviews for bathrooms in that area. This is a great way to checkout
any locations lavatory to see if this is a place you wish to make a rest stop at. Everyone has
different needs especially when it comes to bathroom habits and it is a small creature comfort
to know what to expect before you dare to use a facility at a certain location. Just remember to check the reviews before you gottaGO.
